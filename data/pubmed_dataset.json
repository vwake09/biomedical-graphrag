      "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system provides adaptive immunity against plasmids and phages in prokaryotes. This system inspires the development of a powerful genome engineering tool, the CRISPR/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing system. Due to its high efficiency and precision, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique has been employed to explore the functions of cancer-related genes, establish tumor-bearing animal models and probe drug targets, vastly increasing our understanding of cancer genomics. Here, we review current status of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in oncological research. We first explain the basic principles of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and introduce several new CRISPR-based gene editing modes. We next detail the rapid progress of CRISPR screening in revealing tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance mechanisms. In addition, we introduce CRISPR/Cas9 system delivery vectors and finally demonstrate the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to enhance the effect of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) and reduce adverse reactions.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their cooperation with CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes is one of the greatest advances of the century and has marked their application as a powerful genome engineering tool. The CRISPR-Cas system was discovered as a part of the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea to defend from plasmids and phages. CRISPR has been found to be an advanced alternative to zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) for gene editing and regulation, as the CRISPR-Cas9 protein remains the same for various gene targets and just a short guide RNA sequence needs to be altered to redirect the site-specific cleavage. Due to its high efficiency and precision, the Cas9 protein derived from the type II CRISPR system has been found to have applications in many fields of science. Although CRISPR-Cas9 allows easy genome editing and has a number of benefits, we should not ignore the important ethical and biosafety issues. Moreover, any tool that has great potential and offers significant capabilities carries a level of risk of being used for non-legal purposes. In this review, we present a brief history and mechanism of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We also describe on the applications of this technology in gene regulation and genome editing; the treatment of cancer and other diseases; and limitations and concerns of the use of CRISPR-Cas9.",

CRISPR-Cas9 has shown great promise for the treatment of cancer.

Numerous studies have shown that this system can precisely target a wide range of human genes, including those associated with diseases such as cancer. In cancer research, the intricate genetic mutations in tumors have promoted extensive utilization of the CRISPR/Cas9 system due to its efficient and accurate gene editing capabilities. This includes improvements in Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy, the establishment of tumor models, and gene and drug target screening. Such progress has propelled the investigation of cancer molecular mechanisms and the advancement of precision medicine. However, the therapeutic potential of genome editing remains underexplored, and lingering challenges could elevate the risk of additional genetic mutations. Here, we elucidate the fundamental principles of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and its practical applications in tumor research. We also briefly discuss the primary challenges faced by CRISPR technology and existing solutions, intending to enhance the efficacy of this gene editing therapy and shed light on the underlying mechanisms of tumors.",

In this Review, we discuss recent developments of various CRISPR-based systems that can transiently or permanently modify the genome and the transcriptome. The discovery of further CRISPR enzymes and systems through functional metagenomics has meaningfully broadened the applicability of CRISPR-based editing. Engineered Cas variants offer diverse capabilities such as base editing, prime editing, gene insertion and gene regulation, thereby providing a panoply of tools for the scientific community. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of current CRISPR tools, considering their efficiency, precision, specificity, reliance on cellular DNA repair mechanisms and their applications in both fundamental biology and therapeutics. Finally, we discuss ongoing clinical trials that illustrate the potential impact of CRISPR systems on human health.",

Currently, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has been becoming one of the most promising tools for treating human genetic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neuro-disorders, and cancers. As the quick modification of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including delivery system, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene therapy has been extensively studied in preclinic and clinic treatments. CRISPR/Cas genome editing is also a robust tool to create animal genetic models for studying and treating human genetic disorders, particularly diseases associated with point mutations. However, significant challenges also remain before CRISPR/Cas technology can be routinely employed in the clinic for treating different genetic diseases, which include toxicity and immune response of treated cells to CRISPR/Cas component, highly throughput delivery method, and potential off-target impact. The off-target effect is one of the major concerns for CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy, more research should be focused on limiting this impact by designing high specific gRNAs and using high specificity of Cas enzymes. Modifying the CRISPR/Cas9 delivery method not only targets a specific tissue/cell but also potentially limits the off-target impact.",

      "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of cancer are the major health issue worldwide. Apart from the treatments developed to date, the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of cancers have not been addressed by broadening the toolbox. The advent of immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in the treatments of solid tumors, but remains limited and requires breaking adverse effects. Meanwhile, the development of advanced technologies can be further boosted by gene analysis and manipulation at the molecular level. The advent of cutting-edge genome editing technology, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas9), has demonstrated its potential to break the limits of immunotherapy in cancers. In this review, the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing and a powerful CRISPR toolbox are introduced. Furthermore, we focus on reviewing the impact of CRISPR-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) on cancer immunotherapy (knockout or knockin). Finally, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide screening for target identification, emphasis the potential of spatial CRISPR genomics, and present the comprehensive application and challenges in basic research, translational medicine and clinics of CRISPR-Cas9.",

The ability of sequence-specific addition or removal of DNA in an efficient and cost-effective manner has revolutionized modern research in the field of life science and healthcare. CRISPR is widely used as a genome engineering tool in clinical studies for observing gene expression and metabolic pathway regulations in detail. Even in the case of transgenic research and personalized gene manipulation studies, CRISPR-based technology is used extensively. To understand and even to correct the underlying genetic problem is of cancer, CRISPR-based technology can be used. Various kinds of work is going on throughout the world which are attempting to target different genes in order to discover novel and effective methodologies for the treatment of cancer. In this review, we provide a brief overview on the application of CRISPR gene editing technology in cancer treatment focusing on the key aspects of cancer screening, modelling and therapy techniques.",
